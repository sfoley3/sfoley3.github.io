I think a lot about food. I have been influenced by [Michael Pollan](https://michaelpollan.com/), [Anthony Bourdain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain), and [Matt Goulding](https://roadsandkingdoms.com/). Their work shaped how I think about food, culture, and environment.

Recently, I have tried to follow more of the rules in [*Food Rules*](https://michaelpollan.com/books/food-rules/). The core idea is: "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." One rule I come back to often is: "Eat all the junk food you want as long as you cook it yourself."
