I am first year PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/) at the University of Southern California. My research interests are primarily in experimental phonetics, laboratory phonology, and computational linguistics. Before coming to USC, I completed my MA in Linguistics at [UNC-Chapel Hill](https://linguistics.unc.edu/) under the advising of [Elliott Moreton](https://users.castle.unc.edu/~moreton/) and [Jeff Mielke](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/jimielke/). Before that I was a lecturer at [Shanghai International Studies University](http://en.shisu.edu.cn/).
